Levothyroxine Sodium (T4)

DOSAGE:
Levothyroxine Sodium (T4) 50mcg/tab

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 satchet, 50 tabs, 50mcg per tab

WHAT IS IT:
Thyroxine, also called tetraiodothyronine (usually abbreviated T4), is the main type of thyroid hormone secreted by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It is used to increase the basal metabolic rate, promoting weight and fat loss.

HOW TO USE:
Its use dose will depend on the use that you want to give it. If what we want is simply to use it in order to avoid a certain adaptation at the level of the basal metabolic rate, limit yourself to using T4 at a daily dose of between 12.5 to 50mcg daily. If we want to use it to significantly increase the basal metabolic rate, the dose to be used will be 250mcg daily. The dose is taken once a day on an empty stomach.

Clenbuterol HCL

DOSAGE:
Clenbuterol HCL 40mcg/tab

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 satchet, 100 tabs, 40mcg per tab

WHAT IS IT:
Clenbuterol is a sympathomimetic amine used by sufferers of breathing disorders as a decongestant and bronchodilator. In terms of the use of clenbuterol for strength athletes and bodybuilders, its function as a beta-2 agonist can help to increase lipolysis. This is accomplished via an increase in basal metabolic rate, as well as increased heat production in the mitochondria which serves to increase body temperature and therefore increasing thermogenesis. Additionally, it has been shown that clenbuterol is able to directly stimulate fat cells and accelerate the breakdown of triglycerides, thus forming free fatty acids.

HOW TO USE:
Although it has a very long half-life, it is recommendable to divide the dose into three doses spaced throughout the day. The initial dose is usually 20mcgs, it is advisable to increase the dose little by little each time it stops exerting its effect (it is advisable to look for a template of a clenbuterol pyramid cycle). To avoid unwanted side effects such as tachycardia or cardiac remodeling, it is advisable to combine it with low doses of Nebivolol.
