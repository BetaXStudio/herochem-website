product-title: ASTERA NANDROLONE DECANOATE 300
chemical-description: Nandrolone Decanoate
CAS Number: 521-12-0
Molecular Weight: 304.47 g/mol
Formula: C20H32O2
Overview: Nandrolone is a widely used steroid belonging to the 19 nors family. 19-Nors are generally characterized by their anabolism and progestogenic activity. They are very anabolic, but they also exhibit significant amounts of satellite interaction with other receptors in the body. The most notable being their interaction with the Progesterone receptor. 19-Nor derived progestins are agonists of the Progesterone receptor, which means that they can bind to the Progesterone receptor and activate it. Nandrolone causes a reduction in the ability to perceive pain (which increase is confused with a healing effect) and can also be reduced to DHN, DHN can displace DHT from its receptors causing several side effects, among which mood swings stand out and absence of erections, this can be remedied using Masteron, Proviron or some other steroid that reacts directly with the androgen receptor through DHT.
Mechanism of Action: Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid that binds to androgen receptors, promoting protein synthesis and collagen synthesis. It enhances nitrogen retention, increases bone density, and stimulates red blood cell production while having lower androgenic effects than testosterone.
Dosage: Normal doses are usually 200 to 400 mg per week for beginners and intermediate athletes, with the possibility of using 800 per week for specific or competitive purposes. Since it has a long ester it is recommended to inject it EOD or E3D.
Side Effects: Common side effects include water retention, potential gynecomastia, acne, hair loss, suppression of natural testosterone production, potential cardiovascular strain, mood changes, and virilization in women. May cause "deca dick" (erectile dysfunction).
Composition: Nandrolone Decanoate 300mg/ml

chemical-description: Trestolone Acetate
CAS Number: 434-22-0
Molecular Weight: 274.40 g/mol
Formula: C18H26O2
Overview: The most potent steroid known as Trestolone Acetate, which is the methylated version of Nandrolone and has a potency far higher than Trenbolone, is widely regarded as a combination of the two. It is a highly aromatizable substance, so if it is utilized, care should be made to manage estradiol using alternative methods or lower dosages than would be typical for regular substances. It isn't turned into DHT. It is the chemical that has the highest milligram-to-milligram inhibition constant, and one of its uses is as a male contraceptive.
Mechanism of Action: This compound works through specific biochemical pathways to exert its effects on target tissues and cellular processes.
Dosage: The dosage depends on the user. By way of contact, doses of 5–10 mg per day (35–70 mg per week) are very common. More experienced users typically use 10–25 mg per day (70–175 mg per week) or even 25–50 mg per day (150–350 mg per week). We advise increasing the dose weekly until you find the dose that best meets your needs. Typically, cycles last 8 to 12 weeks.
Side Effects: Side effects include significant water retention, gynecomastia, acne, hair loss, severe suppression of natural testosterone production, potential cardiovascular strain, mood swings, increased aggression, and virilization in women.

product-title: ASTERA TRESTOLONE ENANTHATE 50
chemical-description: Trestolone Enanthate
CAS Number: 434-22-0
Molecular Weight: 274.40 g/mol
Formula: C18H26O2
Overview: TRESTOLONE ENANTHATE (MENT) is a potent anabolic steroid derived from the hormone nandrolone. It is popularly considered a mix between Trenbolone and Nandrolone, offering a powerful combination of strength and size gains. With a higher potency than Trenbolone, Trestolone Enanthate is one of the most powerful steroids available. This compound aromatizes heavily, meaning it converts to estrogen in the body. Users should be aware of this and take appropriate measures to control estradiol levels, utilizing different strategies than those typically used with less potent compounds or opting for smaller doses. Trestolone Enanthate does not convert to DHT, which reduces the risk of hair loss and other DHT-related side effects. Interestingly, it has a high inhibition constant, and one of the uses of this substance is as a male contraceptive.
Mechanism of Action: This compound works through specific biochemical pathways to exert its effects on target tissues and cellular processes.
Dosage: The dose of Trestolone Enanthate varies depending on the user's experience and goals. Common doses range from 5-10mg per day (35-70mg per week) for beginners, while more advanced users may use 10-25mg per day (70-175mg per week) or even 25-50mg per day (175-350mg per week). It is recommended to increase the dose gradually, on a weekly basis, until the desired effects are achieved. Cycles typically last 8-12 weeks, with users carefully monitoring their response to the compound and adjusting dosage as needed to optimize results while minimizing potential side effects. After the cycle is complete, a post-cycle therapy (PCT) is recommended to help restore natural testosterone production and maintain the gains achieved during the cycle.
Side Effects: Potential side effects may include but are not limited to: injection site reactions, changes in mood, potential hormonal imbalances, and individual sensitivity reactions. Consult with a healthcare professional before use and monitor for any adverse reactions.

product-title: ASTERA TAMOXIFEN 20
chemical-description: Tamoxifen citrate
CAS Number: 171596-29-5
Molecular Weight: 389.40 g/mol
Formula: C22H19N3O4
Overview: Tamoxifen citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Selective estrogen receptor modulators can act as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. This activity of tamoxifen citrate is tissue selective, effecting those estrogen receptors located in the liver, breast, and bone. When the tamoxifen molecule binds to this receptor, the estrogen is blocked and can't have any effect. For bodybuilders Tamoxifen citrate can help in two ways. Firstly due to the binding affinity of the compound it is able to help in the prevention of gynecomastia. Tamoxifen will compete with estrogen for the estrogen receptors in certain tissues, including the breast, and if it can bind to the receptor estrogen will not have an opportunity to interact with receptor and therefore gynocomastia should not be able to develop. The second, and possibly more beneficial, aspect of tamoxifen citrate for steroid users is its ability to increase the production of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, and therefore increasing testosterone. This ability is why it is often used by steroid users during their post-cycle therapy.
