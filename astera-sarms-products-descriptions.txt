WHAT IS IT: Cardarine, also known as GW501516, is a PPAR-delta activator rather than a SARM. It has become quite popular in bodybuilding since it may support fat burning, recovery, and enhanced endurance. By activating PPAR-delta, Cardarine stimulates energy metabolism genes, increasing fatty acid oxidation and potentially boosting endurance levels.
HOW TO USE: Cardarine (GW501516) is commonly used in bodybuilding and endurance sports for its potential to aid in fat loss, recovery, and endurance enhancement. Recommended dosages start at 10 mg per day for beginners, while more experienced users may opt for up to 20 mg daily.
BATCH INFORMATION: Batch No: PK38368, Manufacturing date: 03.2023, Expiry date: 03.2026

DOSAGE: LGD4033 Ligandrol 10 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet of 50 tablets, each containing 10 mg
WHAT IS IT: Ligandrol, also known as LGD4033, is a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) known for its potential to promote rapid muscle gain. Recognized as a top choice for bulking among both male and female bodybuilders, Ligandrol supports increased anabolic activity, enhanced strength, and substantial muscle growth.
HOW TO USE: A beginner dose would be around 10 mg/day, intermediate being 20mg per day and for advanced users it would range from 30-40mg per day. It can be taken once per day, preferably in the morning with food.

MK2866 10:
DOSAGE: MK-2866 Ostarine 10 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet containing 50 tablets, each with 10 mg
WHAT IS IT: Ostarine, also known as MK-2866, is a powerful and selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) designed to improve strength, endurance, and lean muscle mass. It is especially beneficial during fat loss or cutting phases, as it preserves muscle mass, prevents muscle loss, supports connective tissue repair, stimulates lean muscle growth and enhances bone density.
HOW TO USE: For Ostarine MK-2866, the recommended daily dosage ranges from 10 mg to 50 mg. Beginners are recommended to start at a conservative 10 mg daily, intermediate users may consider increasing to 25 mg per day, while advanced users can take up to 50 mg daily. Higher doses like 100mg can increase muscle dryness, fat loss and overall muscle gains but may also elevate the risk of side effects.
BATCH INFORMATION: Batch No: FQ25683, Manufacturing date: 03.2023, Expiry date: 03.2026

MK677 10:
DOSAGE: MK-677 Ibutamoren 10 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet of 50 tablets, each containing 10 mg
WHAT IS IT: Ibutamoren, also known as MK-677, is a compound that stimulates growth hormone release, resulting in elevated levels of both growth hormone and IGF-1 in the body. Its effects are aimed at improving bone and muscle mass, increasing bone mineral density, enhancing sleep quality, boosting memory function, and strengthening the immune system. For experienced users, a dosage of 20-30 mg per day is typically well-tolerated, balancing desired effects with minimized side effect risks. This dosage is popular among bodybuilders looking to optimize muscle growth. For new users, a lower starting dose of 10mg daily is advised, with gradual increases as needed to suit individual tolerance.
HOW TO USE: The recommended dosage for MK-677 Ibutamoren is generally between 10 and 30 mg, taken once daily. Most users find that 20-30 mg per day achieves optimal effects. It is recommended to take 10mg before breakfast and 10mg before going to bed.
BATCH INFORMATION: Batch No: TR06043, Manufacturing date: 03.2023, Expiry date: 03.2026

RAD140 10:
DOSAGE: RAD140 Testolone 10 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet of 50 tablets, each containing 10 mg
WHAT IS IT: Testolone, also referred to as RAD140, is a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) recognized for its strong potential to promote muscle growth. Known as one of the most effective SARMs for mass gain, it is highly valued for enhancing muscle size and strength. RAD140 specifically targets muscle development, supporting both muscle growth and brain function. Beyond bulking, RAD140 is also suitable for cutting cycles, as it helps develop lean muscle tissue while supporting fat loss, making it a versatile option for different fitness goals, also it's great for strength performance.
HOW TO USE: For best results, RAD140 is typically used in cycles of up to 8 weeks. A daily intake of 10-30 mg is often recommended for strength enhancement, with effective doses ranging from 10 mg to 100 mg. It is advised not to exceed an 8-week cycle.
BATCH INFORMATION: Batch No: OE56867, Manufacturing date: 03.2023, Expiry date: 03.2026

S23 10:
DOSAGE: S23 10 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet of 50 tablets, each containing 10 mg
WHAT IS IT: S23 is a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) taken orally, known for its ability to enhance lean muscle mass and increase bone density. Unlike traditional steroids, S23 is tissue-selective, meaning it specifically targets certain tissues. It helps reduce water retention, promoting a more defined, chiseled appearance with increased muscle hardness and a grainy texture. It is probably the most powerful SARM available in the market.
HOW TO USE: For optimal results, a daily dosage of 10-30 mg is recommended for men, divided into two doses due to S23's 12-hour half-life. Since it's really powerful it is recommended to not exceed 6 weeks of daily intake and to take a liver support product like TUDCA with it.

It is currently as not as popular among bodybuilders and athletes as it used to be in the past. The key benefits of S4 include promoting muscle growth, increasing strength, enhancing bone mineral density, reducing body fat, accelerating muscle recovery, and delivering fast gains.
HOW TO USE: For new users, a starting dose of 25 mg per day is commonly recommended for the first two weeks, after which the dosage may be gradually increased. However, it is advised not to exceed a daily dose of 50 mg because it can cause eye vision problems such as nictalopia. Dose should be divided into at least two dosages.

It is appreciated within the bodybuilding community for its potential to boost exercise capacity, improve endurance, and aid in fat loss.
HOW TO USE: The recommended dosage range for Stenabolic is between 10 mg and 40 mg per day, often divided into two or three doses throughout the day due to its short half-life of approximately 4 to 6 hours.

YK11 5:
DOSAGE: YK11 5 mg per tablet
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Sachet of 50 tablets, each containing 5 mg
WHAT IS IT: YK11 is technically considered a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) known for its potent Myostatin inhibition capabilities. By blocking Myostatin, YK11 allows users to push beyond our natural genetic limitations, enabling significant muscle growth. It has been designed to promote muscle growth and strength gain.
HOW TO USE: Even a low dose of 5 mg per day for a cycle of 4-8 weeks can produce noticeable muscle gains. However, for optimal results, many users prefer a daily dosage of 10-20mg. It is recommended to use at the end of the cycle when the muscle growth rate has reached a plateau.
