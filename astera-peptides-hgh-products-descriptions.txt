HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)

DOSAGE:
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), 5000 IU per vial

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 vial containing 5000 IU of injectable solution

WHAT IS IT:
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) is a highly effective injectable hormone that mimics the function of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the body. It is commonly used to support fertility in women, restore natural testosterone levels in men with low testosterone, and prevent testicular shrinkage during anabolic steroid cycles. HCG promotes ovulation, boosts testosterone production, maintains testicular function, and enhances sperm quality, making it a valuable tool for reproductive health and hormonal balance both in men and women.

HOW TO USE:
The recommended dosage of HCG depends on its purpose:

• For Fertility (Women):
HCG is used to trigger ovulation in women undergoing fertility treatment. The typical protocol involves a single intramuscular injection of 5,000–10,000 IU, administered approximately 36 hours before planned intrauterine insemination (IUI) or egg retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF).

• For Fertility Support (Men):
A typical dose ranges from 500–1000 IU, administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, two to three times weekly.

HGH (Human Growth Hormone)

DOSAGE:
Human Growth Hormone (HGH), 16 IU per vial

PACKAGE CONTENT:
10 vials, each containing 16 IU of injectable solution

WHAT IS IT:
Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pituitary gland, essential for growth, development, and tissue regeneration. Synthetic HGH, identical to the natural hormone, is used to treat growth disorders in children and hormone deficiencies in adults. It is also sought after for its potential benefits in muscle growth, fat loss, and anti-aging. HGH supports muscle development, promotes fat breakdown, enhances bone density, and aids in the repair of connective tissues, making it a versatile hormone for health and performance optimization.

HOW TO USE:
• For General Use:
Typical dosages range from 1–4 IU per day. Lower doses (1-2IUs) are often used for anti-aging or wellness, while higher doses (3-10IUs) may be prescribed for therapeutic or performance-enhancing purposes, for example 3IUs would be used for fat burning purposes, and 4-8IUs for mass gaining purposes.

• Administration:
HGH is administered via subcutaneous injection into the fatty tissue of the abdomen, thighs, or buttocks.

• Timing:
Injections are typically given in the morning or before bedtime to align with the body's natural secretion patterns, optimizing its effects, if the dosage is above 2IU it should be divided equally between morning and bedtime, also it should be injected on an empty stomach.

HGH Fragment 176-191

DOSAGE:
HGH Fragment 176-191, 10 mg per vial

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 vial containing 10 mg of injectable solution

WHAT IS IT:
HGH Fragment 176-191 is a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence of human growth hormone (HGH). Unlike traditional HGH, this fragment specifically targets fat loss and metabolic enhancement without impacting growth or insulin sensitivity. By stimulating fat breakdown (lipolysis) and reducing fat storage (lipogenesis), it helps decrease body fat while preserving lean muscle mass, making it an effective tool for improving body composition and metabolic health.

HOW TO USE:
• Dosage:
A typical daily dosage ranges from 250 mcg to 500 mcg, divided into multiple injections for optimal effectiveness, for example it can be taken in the morning and before a workout.

• Administration:
Administer HGH Fragment 176-191 via subcutaneous injection into the fatty tissue of the abdomen or thighs.

• Timing:
For best results, injections are recommended before meals and prior to workouts to enhance fat-burning effects and maximize benefits.

Melanotan 2

DOSAGE:
Melanotan II Peptide Hormone, 10 mg per vial

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 vial containing 10 mg of injectable peptide solution

WHAT IS IT:
Melanotan II is a synthetic analog of the peptide hormone alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is primarily responsible for promoting skin tanning by stimulating melanin production. This peptide not only enhances skin pigmentation but also exhibits other notable benefits. It has aphrodisiac properties that positively influence libido and sexual function. Additionally, Melanotan II is known to have a mild fat-mobilizing effect, making it a versatile option for those seeking improvements in body aesthetics and composition.

HOW TO USE:
For optimal results, Melanotan II should be administered according to the following protocol:

• Initial Phase: Begin with a daily dose of 300 mcg for 1 to 2 weeks. This lower starting dosage helps the body adapt to the peptide while minimizing potential side effects such as nausea.

• Maintenance Phase: After the initial period, transition to a maintenance dosage of 500 mcg twice weekly to keep the desired effects.

Melanotan II injections are administered subcutaneously into the fatty tissue, typically in the abdominal region.

Starting with lower dosages is particularly important to improve tolerance and reduce the likelihood of nausea.

TB500 & BPC157

DOSAGE:
TB500 (Thymosin Beta-4) and BPC157 (Body Protection Compound-157), 10 mg per vial

PACKAGE CONTENT:
1 vial containing 10 mg of injectable peptide solution

WHAT IS IT:
TB500 and BPC157 are synthetic peptides widely recognized for their powerful regenerative properties and their ability to support injury recovery and tissue repair. TB500, derived from Thymosin Beta-4, promotes cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, which are essential processes for efficient wound healing and tissue regeneration. BPC157, on the other hand, stimulates the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and boosts collagen production, contributing to the healing of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other tissues. When used together, these peptides work synergistically to enhance recovery from injuries, reduce inflammation, and improve overall tissue health.

HOW TO USE:
• Dosage:
The recommended dosage depends on the type and severity of the injury. A typical protocol involves administering 2 mg to 10 mg per week of each peptide, split into several smaller doses to ensure sustained effects.

• Administration:
TB500 and BPC157 can be injected either subcutaneously into the fatty tissue or intramuscularly near the site of the injury, some users have reported that IM have a better effect but there isn't any scientific research backing those claims.

• Treatment Duration:
The length of treatment varies based on the individual's response and the nature of the injury. For most cases, treatment can last a few weeks (4-6 weeks) to several months.
