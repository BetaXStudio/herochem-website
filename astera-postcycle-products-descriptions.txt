POST CYCLE - ASTERA PRODUCTS DESCRIPTIONS (6 Products)
===========================================================

1. ASTERA ANASTROZOLE 1
(DOSAGE: Anastrozole 1mg/tab
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 satchet, 50 tabs, 1mg per tab
WHAT IS IT: Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors prevent the conversion of androgens into estrogen in fat, muscle, breast, and brain. The medical use of Anastrozole is primarily to inhibit the progression and growth of breast cancer in women by blocking the aromatase enzyme. It has also been used by some doctors to try and treat low testosterone production in men, as well as being used in conjunction with testosterone replacement therapy. For bodybuilders and strength athletes, Anastrozole is used to minimize the aromatization of anabolic steroids, and to a lesser extent for it's ability to raise testosterone levels in users. By reducing the amount of estrogen in a steroid user's body he will be able to avoid estrogen related side effects such as water retention, gynocomastia, etc.
HOW TO USE: The dosage varies greatly depending on the user and the aromatizing compounds being used, some users will find that 0.5mgs used E3.5D is enough to not have any estrogenic side effects.

6. ASTERA TAMOXIFEN 20
(DOSAGE: Tamoxifen citrate 20mg/tab
PACKAGE CONTENT: 1 satchet, 50 tabs, 20mg per tab
WHAT IS IT: Tamoxifen citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Selective estrogen receptor modulators can act as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. This activity of tamoxifen citrate is tissue selective, effecting those estrogen receptors located in the liver, breast, and bone. When the tamoxifen molecule binds to this receptor, the estrogen is blocked and can't have any effect. For bodybuilders Tamoxifen citrate can help in two ways. Firstly due to the binding affinity of the compound it is able to help in the prevention of gynecomastia. Tamoxifen will compete with estrogen for the estrogen receptors in certain tissues, including the breast, and if it can bind to the receptor estrogen will not have an opportunity to interact with receptor and therefore gynocomastia should not be able to develop. The second, and possibly more beneficial, aspect of tamoxifen citrate for steroid users is its ability to increase the production of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, and therefore increasing testosterone. This ability is why it is often used by steroid users during their post-cycle therapy.
HOW TO USE: The dose to treat both gynecomastia and to be used in PCT varies between 20-40mg per day, the dose has to be adjusted until the desired effect is achieved.
